A. Things for Arun to calculate:

       1. Thetas (all of the below come from the same command)
          -Watterson
	  -Pairwise
	  -Singleton
	  -thetaH
	  -thetaL

       2. Tajima's D

B. Subsets of sites on which to calculate these
   
   1. Whole genome

   2. Potentially neutral
      -Non-coding sites (exclude genes and +/- 5kb of genes)
      -Four-fold degenerate sites
      -Exclude constrained sites (exclude high GERP score)

   3. Potentially selected
      -Coding sites (including +/- 5kb)
      -Constrained sites (only include high GERP score)
